<h1>Spotlight is a desk based speaker that connects you to your music.</h1>
<h2>Originally designed as part of a University Project, Spotlight is based around, surprisingly, an old fashioned Spotlight.</h2>

<h2>The initial University project stemmed two creations on this website, the first was Spotlight, the other Urchin (the light project on this site). The University asked us to split into groups of up to four people, and begin to work on a product design project that would eventually produce a product that had a need to be 3D printed.</h2>
<h2>Our brand statement as defined on our website states:</h2>
<h2>Allure Lincoln are a design collective containing four current students from the University of Lincoln. Allure were founded on the sole principle of making bespoke product design accessible to companies no matter their size. In order to achieve this goal we are utilising the power and flexibility of 3D printing as it continues to grow and open up new avenues for small scale manufacture.</h2>

<h2>The Spotlight Speaker is composed of two main parts. First the shell of the speaker is manufactured from a ceramic solution, slip cast, fired and then glossed to a super high finish. The external caging is meticulously crafted from a range high quality brass tubing, which I believe not only enhances the visual aesthetic of this product, but provides the perfect support for a speaker like Spotlight.</h2>
