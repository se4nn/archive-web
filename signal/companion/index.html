<h1>Beacon’s companion app provides another way to connect.</h1>
<h2>Beacon can be split into two almost separate projects, both working to achieve the same goal. That goal is to simplify your connected lifestyle. If you haven’t read my other article about Beacon and wish to gain more information about the product then please click here.</h2>

<h2>The companion app for Beacon has had a considerable change in focus since it’s original conception. Initially, Beacon was going to literally act as a beacon and listen then display all the information given to it by the app itself. However I had a change of tact, and decided that Beacon would be the hub of information and you could use the companion app to compliment it.</h2>

<h2>Beacon’s companion app was designed simply to make it easier to operate your Beacon remotely. However in some situations the app is essential to making things just that bit easier to do. An example of this would be logging into a service in order to receive notifications from it. </h2>
<h2>Slack, is a great service, for those of you who don’t know Slack provides a platform for easy inter-company communication and therefore is a prime example of a service that I would love to integrate into Beacon.</h2>
<h2>However trying to type in information such as a username and password using the dial interface of Beacon would prove to be an issue, therefore the companion app here is a must.</h2>

<h2>Another feature of the companion app actually makes it a viable addition to the Beacon. Obviously, Beacon could be used solely as an alarm clock, I’m hoping that people could find more than this one use for it, but none the less, if it is to be an alarm clock, then it will be the best one you can buy.</h2>
<h2>All smartphones now, come with an acceleromator built-in which not controls the orientation of your camera, which direction you turn in a racing game but it can also be used to track incredibly small movements. Using this data, I would be able to track the users movements in their sleep (with their permission) in order to wake them up when they are just coming out of a deep sleep. Not only does this leave you feeling more refreshed, but it gives you an added boost throughout the day as you are no longer fatigued.</h2>
